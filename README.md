üëã Hello, I'm Oreoluwa!

I'm a dedicated PhD student in Physics with a deep passion for machine learning, data science, and computational modeling. My work bridges the worlds of theoretical physics and artificial intelligence, and I'm always exploring new ways to apply these skills to solve real-world problems. My PhD research focuses on microgels and colloidal mixtures, where I use Monte Carlo simulations and molecular dynamics to study phase transitions and interactions at a granular level. I also apply machine learning techniques to predict and analyze the behaviors of these complex systems.

üîß Tools & Technologies:
Programming: Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn), R, Java
Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Physics Simulation: Monte Carlo, Molecular Dynamics, High-Performance Computing (HPC)
NLP & Computer Vision: HuggingFace Transformers, OpenCV, CNNs, YOLO
Quantitative Skills: Machine Learning, Regression, Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistical Analysis, Hyperparameter Tuning, Deep Learning Techniques, Web Scraping, Transfer Learning, Image Classification, Object Detection

üéØ My Mission:
I'm driven by the challenge of solving complex problems, whether it's through cutting-edge AI techniques or in-depth physical simulations. My goal is to make meaningful contributions to science and technology, blending the best of both worlds.

ü§ù Let's Connect!
I'm always open to collaborations, new opportunities, or just a good conversation about science, AI, or anything else that sparks curiosity. Feel free to reach out!
